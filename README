# Webmachine TODOs App #

This app showcases the [Todos](http://emberjs.com/examples/todos/) example from Ember.js using Webmachine and MySQL as backend.

The original Javascript code has been adapted to use Webmachine as backend and to be able to persist state on the server.

This project was part of a hackday at [Liip](http://www.liip.ch). The app was build by [Alvaro Videla](https://twitter.com/#!/old_sound) and [Vedran Zgela](https://twitter.com/#!/vedranzgela).

# Setup #

Simply clone the project and then run make:



# MySQL Setup #

    CREATE TABLE `todo` (
      `slug` char(32) NOT NULL,
      `title` varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
      `isDone` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      PRIMARY KEY (`slug`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
